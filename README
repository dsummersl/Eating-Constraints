I built this page for the vizathlon contest (I won Best in Show) -
http://www.stratavizathlon.com/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data:

The data is all in the /testdata folder.

The original data sets:
 - ingredients.csv
 - ingredientRanks.csv

The CSV files are copies of the original data set. I cleaned up any
non-ingredients and removed any badly formed HTML codes. I also added a columns
to separate the package size from the product name, and I added a column so
that I could tag specific ingredients as 'Corn' or 'Oil' or 'Eggs', etc. A
plain speak tag.

Clustering dataset:
 - calorieclusters.csv

This csv was generated by applying a k-means clustering algorithm to the
ingredients.csv file. I normalized the data by calorie ( protein/calorie,
sugar/calorie, carbs/calorie, etc). The CSV was generated by
vizathlon_clustering.py. I cleaned up and combined a few of the final
categories as they weren't human-discernable (looked the same to me).

CSV -> JSON

Each CSV file was converted to json by passing the CSV files thru CSVtoJSON.py.

Viz:

The index.html presents the main visualization. The bulk of the code was
written in js/util.js. It reads the JSON data files and creates the
visualizations on screen.

The index.html page has a debug javascript setting that turns on jspec unit
tests.

Use this for testing locally (to avoid any cross site scripting issues you
might encounter):

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

To upload to the server (not ideal - it uploads my git directory too!):

rsync -av --rsh=ssh . pd:/var/www/vizlathon
